Emotion Recognition using Facial and GSR Data:

This project aims to classify 21 different human emotions using synthetic facial and GSR data. The dataset was generated with intentional noise to reflect real-world data imperfections. The project involves preprocessing, exploratory analysis, and classification using machine learning models.

Files:

emotion_dataset1.csv – Clean synthetic dataset
emotion_dataset_noisy.csv – Noisy version of the dataset
emotion_fods.mlx – Main MATLAB Live Script for full workflow
emotion_fods_script.m – Alternate MATLAB script version
fods_report.pdf – Final project report

How to Run:

Open emotion_fods.mlx in MATLAB.
Run all sections sequentially to perform cleaning, EDA, modeling, and evaluation.

Requirements:

MATLAB R2023 or later
Statistics and Machine Learning Toolbox
